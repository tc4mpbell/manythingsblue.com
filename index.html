				I write code for fun.
			</p>
			<p>I've always been interested in game development -- I fell in love with creating things on computers when I was 11, hanging out on AOL forums and discussing GameMaker and Hypercard. In 2015 I did a couple Ludum Dare 48-hour game jams, with great enjoyment and sleepiness.</p>

				<h3>Cheats at Marathons by Not Breathing</h3>
				<small>Ludum Dare 33: August 21st-24th, 2015</small>
				
				<nav>

					<a href='https://github.com/tc4mpbell/ld33-vampire-running-game' target='_blank'>Source Code</a>
				</nav>

				<p>I used PhaserJS here. Good engine, but the docs were confusing. Keeping scope under control made this a complete, if not spectacular, first-ever-game. Code was fantastically bad.</p>

				<h3>Your Very Own Vampire Garden</h3>
				<small>Ludum Dare 34: December 11th-14th, 2015</small>
				
				<nav>
					<a class='btn' href='https://manythingsblue.itch.io/your-very-own-vampire-garden' target="_blank">Play</a>
					~
					<a href='https://github.com/tc4mpbell/ld34-vampire-garden' target='_blank'>Source Code</a>
				</nav>

				<p>I used Phaser as the engine again, this time with the Brand New Magic of Babel so I could use ES6 features (classes!). That all worked well, I only failed in the 'build a fun game' department. Vastly superior to last, code-organization-wise.</p>

					When not writing code...
				</p>
				<p>
					Richmond has a fantastic <a href='http://vmfa.museum' target="_blank">art museum</a>. Anya and I go there whenever opportunity arises.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also like to hang out with my kids -- Imogen loves to read and is currently hooked on <a href='http://code.org' target="_blank">Code.org</a>, which is <em>awesome</em>, Ira is into Star Wars, though he still calls Chewbacca "the bear" sometimes. I read: Gene Wolfe, Neil Gaiman, Iain M. Banks, Terry Pratchett (and of course Tolkien, Lewis, etc.).
				</p>
				<p>
					In the fake sports category, I got into golf a few years ago. I play with my dad once a month or so on a Friday, since we're both off work. It's very addicting, and should be relaxing.
				</p>
				<p>
					I listen to music &ndash; Radiohead, Belle and Sebastian, Libertines, Punch Brothers, Sturgill Simpson, Vampire Weekend. I should listen to more Beethoven.
