<h1>Advanced Rails, or Hacking your mind for easier urinal usage</h1>
<p>So when you stride confidently to the urinal for some reason, forgetting that you have a traitorous Benedict Arnold bladder and should really use a stall, where the growing embarrassment of standing silent next to a procession of back-slapping glad-handers whizzing effortlessly into the Duchamp masterpieces next to you.</p>

<p>One easy trick: Think consciously about something else. It's kind of hard, like <em>QUICK, DON'T THINK ABOUT AN ELEPHANT</em>, but here are the tips that have led me to some small, intermittent victory:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Think of something else.</li>
  <li>Free-word association works. You want to get your mind working on something besides preventing pee.</li>
  <li>Develop a trigger phrase to start this. Trains your brain to dive eagerly into this new game of coming up with words that make sense.</li>
  <li>For instance, I stare at a crack in the wall and starting thinking Albino Alligators, and proceed with their adventures.
    <li><em>Albino alligators effortlessly amble across acres of angry alphabetically sorted sand swans waving swishing swimming swanning sunnily ... (etcetera)</em></li>
  </li>
  <li>When free association begins to lose its potent brain-distracting effect, I try to spell DHH's name. This is an advanced technique, perhaps more relevant for Rails developers. My brain really has to search for this one. (Two n's? Two m's? Two s's?) Works like a charm.</li>
  <li>You can also combine the two. All's fair.</li>
</ol>
